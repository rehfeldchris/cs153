BTW LOGIC STUFF
BOTH OF WIN AN FAIL                                          BTW and: WIN iff x=WIN, y=WIN
EITHER OF WIN AN FAIL                                          BTW or: FAIL iff x=FAIL, y=FAIL
WON OF WIN AN FAIL                                          BTW xor: FAIL if x=y
NOT WIN                                           BTW unary negation: WIN if x=FAIL
ALL OF WIN AN FAIL AN WIN AN WIN MKAY                 BTW infinite arity AND
ANY OF WIN AN FAIL AN FAIL AN FAIL MKAY          BTW infinite arity OR


BTW YOU CAN NEST OPERATORS LIKE
BOTH OF WIN AN EITHER OF WIN AN FAIL


BTW EQUALITY OPERATORS
BOTH SAEM 3 AN 3 BTW WIN iff x == y
DIFFRINT 3 AN 4 BTW WIN iff x != y


BTW THE "AN" KEYWORD IS AN OPTIONAL OPERAND SEPERATOR
SUM OF 3 4

BTW Case Statement

SUM OF 3 AN 4
WTF?
  OMG 7
    I HAS A CASE_1 ITZ "SEVEN"
    GTFO

BTW While statement (complete)

I HAS A I ITZ 5
I HAS A SUMVAR ITZ 0

IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR VAR WILE I SMALLR THAN 10
	SUMVAR R SUM OF SUMVAR AN I
IM OUTTA YR LOOP

BTW While statement (infinite)

IM IN YR LOOP
	SUMVAR R SUM OF SUMVAR AN 1
IM OUTTA YR LOOP

BTW While statement (infinite with action)

IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR VAR
	SUMVAR R SUM OF SUMVAR AN VAR
